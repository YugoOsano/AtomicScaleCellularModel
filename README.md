#### Abstract
A Monte Carlo-based model of plasma-surface interactions has been developed to simulate the feature profile evolution during Si etching in nanoscale ULSI device fabrication. The transport of ions, neutral atoms, etch products was analyzed by a two-dimensional particle simulation with three velocity components. To incorporate an atomistic picture into the model, the surface geometry was represented by allocating Si atoms in two-dimensional atomic scale lattices. Moreover, the trajectory of ions was analyzed on the basis of the momentum and energy conservation for an incident ion through successive binary collisions with substrate Si atoms. The resulting etched profiles simultaneously exhibited the formation of surface reaction multilayers on feature bottom, passivation layers on feature sidewalls, and microtrenches at the corner of the feature bottom which was caused by the ions reflected from sloped sidewalls.
